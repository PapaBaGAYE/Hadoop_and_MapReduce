# Conceptualisation of the architecture

A group of banks has developed their activities during the past few months by buying different small agencies. Currently, they realised that each agency process many transactions. The aim of the project is to :
- Create a big data architecture to storage and centralize the data,
- Use the data collected to create data visualiastion with dashboard.
Moreover, the architecture may support a huge volume of data. We consider that there are between 1 and 20 billions of transactions in one hour by agence.
