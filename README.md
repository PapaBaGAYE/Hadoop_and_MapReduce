# Conceptualisation of a data pipeline, MapReduce and Data Ingestion with Kafka

This repo contains the main scripts realised in order to ingest data with Apache Kafka and realise MapReduce operations with Python. You can also find other documentations about the detailled pipeline and the relationnal database. 

- The first directory contains the schema of the detailled pipeline, the conceptual schema of the related database and a script in SQL. The main goal of this script is to create the database.
- The second directory contains the different script of MapReduce realised in Python with the library MRJob.
- The third directory contains the consumer and the producer of the ingestion pipeline realised with Kafka.
